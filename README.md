## To-Do List Application üìù

### Overview

This is a full-stack To-Do List application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with user authentication and authorization powered by **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens). The application allows users to securely create, manage, and update their tasks, ensuring data persistence and seamless interaction.

### Features ‚ú®

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login and registration using JWT, ensuring that each user‚Äôs tasks are private and accessible only to them.
- **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed or pending.
- **Persistence**: Task data is saved in MongoDB, allowing tasks to be stored and retrieved even after a page refresh.
- **Responsive UI**: The app is built with a clean, intuitive interface using **React.js** and styled with **SCSS** for a responsive and flexible layout across devices.
